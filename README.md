# karalib workspace

Workspace for libraries for the RustyKaraoke project

The RustyKaraoke project is created out of sheer pettiness because Extreme Karaoke doesn't have a Linux port, and it has a dongle DRM.

Wine doesn't work with this software and the code is legacy.

## Libraries

- emk-rs: A library for reading EMK archives
